# Small-C-compiler-for-x86
The goal of our project this semester is to develop a prototype C compiler. This is
done by compiling C programs into embedded platforms such as 68K, MIPS, ARM,
or pseudo assemblies. In this class we will mainly use arm as the target codes. The
project is divided into several parts including language definition, scanner,
C-grammar, symbol table handlings, parser, type checker, and code generation. In the
final assignment, you will need to choose the set of language features which you want
to develop the compiler for in this course, and write the whole compiler (including the
code generator). The generated x86 assembly code is expected to be executed on the
machines, mcore8.cs.ccu.edu.tw or linux.cs.ccu.edu.tw.
